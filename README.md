# SewaneeProfessor



This is the start of a website that I created for my web design class with a partner (Spandyandy). We used PHP, CSS, JavaScript and MYSQL in the final product, which can be found here: http://hive.sewanee.edu/oluloep0/SewaneeProfessor-master/. You can also download it on Github here: https://github.com/Spandyandy/SewaneeProfessor.
