# Sewanee Professor Reivew Site

## Introduction

This is the start of a website that I created for my web design class with a partner (Spandyandy). We used PHP, CSS, JavaScript and MYSQL in the final product, previously found [here](http://hive.sewanee.edu/oluloep0/SewaneeProfessor-master/). The final version is on [his Github](https://github.com/Spandyandy/SewaneeProfessor), however site has been duplicated and edited here as well.

## Contents

- Beta version of site - [The previous non-functional UI](/oldSite) with alternative design
- Final version of site - Created based on HTML/CSS/JS, PHP and MYSQL
  - SQL commands to build database in [databaseBuild.sql](databaseBuild.sql)


## Setup

- Install PHP and MYSQL server
  - Ideally install MYSQL server, workbench and shell
- Setup MYSQL username and password to be used by site
- Run the commands in the databaseBuild file to set up db env for testing
- In the [login.php](/php/login.php), add username, password and host registered in MySQL
- Setup your PHP server and you're good to go!

```bash
php -S localhost:8500
``
